The methodology used to compute the PRR considers the risk of the underlying asset class, the risk derived from the specificities of the instrument but also the risk derived from the market conditions.\n| STRUCTURED PRODUCT - SUMMARY OF TERMS | PAGE 2 OF 3\n1805\nDISCLAIMER\nThis material (the \"material\") is not intended for and shall neither be provided to nor used by persons who are citizens of, domiciled or resident in, or entities registered in a country or a jurisdic-tion in which its distribution, publication, provision or use would violate current laws and regulations.

It is for general information only and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all Swiss tax consequences that may be relevant to a decision to purchase, own or dispose of the product. Swiss tax laws and the practice of the Swiss tax authorities may change, possibly with retroactive effect. Prospective Swiss resident, EU resident and third country resident purchasers of the product should consult their own tax advisers concerning the tax consequences of purchasing, holding and disposing of the product in the light of their particular circumstances.\nSwiss Federal Stamp Duty\nThis product is subject to Swiss stamp duty.\nTherefore, secondary market transactions are subject to Swiss stamp duty.\nSwiss Withholding Tax\nThe product is not subject to the Swiss withholding tax.\nSwiss Income Tax\nThis product is classified as transparent, where the majority of the return of the bondpart is in the form of a payment at redemption (IUP). Therefore, private investor with tax domicile in Switzerland, is subject to the Swiss Federal Income Tax on the difference between the bondfloor at purchase and the bondfloor at sale or redemption (if denominated in foreign currency these amounts must be converted into CHF by applying the prevailing exchange rate at purchase date and sale or redemption date when applicable). The present value of the bond part at issue is 99.1048% (ref.rate: 0.7104%).\nHowever, any gain derived from the option is considered as a capital gain and therefore for such investor not subject to the Swiss federal, cantonal or communal Income Tax.\nAutomatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters\nSwitzerland has implemented the Automatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters (\"AEOI\") as of 1st January 2017 with the EU and various other countries and is negotiating the introduction of the AEOI with further countries. The website \"www.sif.admin.ch\" provides an overview of all partner states Switzerland has signed an agreement for the introduction of the AEOI. In this context the EU Savings Tax for Swiss paying agents and the Final Withholding Tax with UK and Austria have been repealed as from 1st January 2017.\n2. PROSPECTS FOR PROFITS AND LOSSES\nMarket Expectations\nA Bonus Certificate offers the possibility to participate in the positive performance of the underlying. Investors in a Bonus Certificate expect the underlying to move sideways or to rise and do not expect the underlying to breach the barrier during the product lifetime\nProfits Prospects\nThe following product is a derivative financial instrument, offering the investor the maximum between a certain bonus level and a participation in the performance of the lowest-performing Underlying Share as long as the lowest-performing Underlying Share closes at or above its Knock-out Price on the Redemption Valuation Date.\nLoss Prospects\nIf the lowest-performing Underlying Share closes below its Knock-out Price on the Redemption Valuation Date, the conditional protection is terminated and the product will be redeemed at par or by cash settlement at the official closing price of the lowest-performing Underlying Share on the Redemption Valuation Date. In the event that the Certificates are redeemed early as a consequence of force mjeure, illegality or certain other events affecting the Underlying(s) and/or hedge, Holders may receive an amount per Certificate equal to the fair market value of each Certificate less the cost to the Issuer and/or its affiliates of unwinding any underlying related hedging arrangements. Such amount may be less than the Notional Amount or even zero. In the event that the Certificates are redeemed early as a consequence of force majeure, illegality or certain other events affecting the Underlying(s) and/or hedge, Holders may receive an amount per Certificate equal to the fair market value of each Certificate less the cost to the Issuer and/or its affiliates of unwinding any underlying related hedging arrangements. Such amount may be less than the Notional Amount or even zero.\nRisk Tolerance\nHolders of this product should be experienced and familiar with both derivative products and the Underlying. Holders must be willing to make an investment that is exposed to the full down-side risk of the Underlying. Holders do not require capital protection. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n3. IMPORTANT RISKS\n5\nEquity Derivatives Solutions\nBNP PARIBAS CORPORATE & INSTITUTIONAL BANKING\n-\nThe bank for a changing world\nGeneral\nAn investment in the Certificates involves a high degree of risk, which may include, among others, price risks associated with the Underlying(s), interest rate, foreign exchange, market, time value and political risks. Potential investors must have the knowledge and experience necessary to enable them to evaluate the risks and merits of an investment in the Certificates. A prospective investor should determine, based on its own independent review and such professional advice (including, without limitation, tax, accounting, credit, legal and regulatory advice) as it deems appropriate under the circumstances, that its acquisition and holding of the Certificates (i) is fully consistent with its financial needs, objectives and condition, (ii) complies and is fully consistent with all investment policies, guidelines and restrictions applicable to it and (iii) is a fit, proper and suitable investment for it, notwithstanding the clear and substantial risks inherent in investing in or holding the Certificates. In making such determination, a prospective investor should consider carefully all the information set forth in the Final Terms and the Base Prospectus.\nNo Capital Protection\nThe Certificates are not capital protected at any time. There is a risk of total capital loss, and therefore an investment in the Certificates is highly speculative, involving significant risk, including the possible loss of all the entire amount invested, and should therefore only be considered by persons who can afford a loss of all of their investment.\nIndex Linked Risks\nAn investment in Certificates linked to a basket of Indices entails significant risks not associated with an investment in a conventional debt security. On redemption Holders will receive an amount (if any) determined by reference to the value of the Indices. Potential investors should take advice accordingly. The movements in the level of an index may be subject to significant fluctuations that may or may not correlate with other indices, changes in interest rates or currencies and the timing of changes in the relevant level of the index may affect the actual yield to Holders, even if the average level of the index is consistent with their expectations.\nEarly Redemption\nThe Terms and Conditions in the Base Prospectus provide for early redemption on the occurrence of force majeure, illegality and certain other events affecting the Underlying(s) and/or the hedge, whereupon the Calculation Agent shall calculate the fair market value of each Certificate less the cost to the Issuer and/or its affiliates of unwinding any underlying related hedging arrangements, all as determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole and absolute discretion. Payment will be made in such manner as shall be notified to Holders in accordance with the Condition 10 of the Base Prospectus. The amount Holders receive as a consequence of such early redemption may be less than the Notional Amount per Certificate or even zero. Holders who choose to reinvest monies received as a consequence of early redemption of the Certificates may be able to do so only in securities with a lower yield than the redeemed Certificates.\nIssuer and Guarantor Risk\nCertificates are unsecured obligations: The Certificates retention of value is dependent not only on the development of the value of the Underlying(s), but also the creditworthiness of the Issuer and the Guarantor, which may change over the term of the product. The Certificates are unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer and will rank pari passu with all other unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer. The obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantee are unsecured obligations of the Guarantor and will rank pari passu with all its other present and future senior preferred and unsecured obligations, subject as may from time to time be mandatory under French law. In addition, the Issuer's and the Guarantor's ability to fulfil their obligations under the Certificates may be affected by certain other factors, including liquidity risks, market risks, credit risks, cross- border and foreign exchange risks, operational risks, legal and regulatory risks and competition risks.\n6\nEquity Derivatives Solutions\nBNP PARIBAS CORPORATE & INSTITUTIONAL BANKING - The bank for a changing world\nPossible Illiquidity of the Certificates in the Secondary Market\nIt is not possible to predict the price at which Certificates will trade in the secondary market. The trading market for the Certificates may be volatile and may be adversely impacted by many events. An active trading market for the Certificates may not develop. The Issuer and/or its affiliates may (but is not obliged to) at any time purchase Certificates in the open market. Any Certificates so purchased may be resold or surrendered for cancellation. To the extent the Certificates are cancelled the number of Certificates outstanding will decrease resulting in diminished liquidity for the remaining Certificates. A decrease in the liquidity of the Certificates may cause, in turn, an increase in the volatility associated with the price of the Certificates. There may be no secondary market for the Certificates and to the extent that such secondary market becomes illiquid, Holders may have to wait until redemption of the Certificates to realise greater value than their then trading value.\nUnpredictable Market Value\nThe market value of, and expected return on, the Certificates may be influenced by a number of factors, some or all of which may be unpredictable (and which may offset or magnify each other), such as (i) supply and demand for the Certificates, (ii) the development of the value of the Underlying(s) (iii) economic, financial, political and regulatory or judicial events that affect the Issuer, the Guarantor, the Underlying(s) or financial markets generally, (iv) interest and yield rates in the markets generally, (v) the time remaining until the Redemption Date and (vi) the creditworthiness of the Issuer and the Guarantor. Such factors may mean that the trading price of the Certificates is below the Notional Amount. In the secondary market a bid/ask spread will generally apply. Holders who choose to sell their Certificates prior to maturity may receive less than the amount invested.\nEffective yield\nA Holder's actual yield on the Certificates may be reduced from the stated yield by transaction costs or the tax impact on that Holder of its investment in the Certificates.\nAdditional Risks\nIn addition, investors should read the section in the Base Prospectus entitled 'Risk Factors'.\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\nNeither BNP Paribas nor any of its affiliates gives any assurance that any Certificate will be issued or any transaction will be entered into on the basis of the terms set out in this document.

You may not be able to recover all or even part of the amount due under the Certificates (if any) from the Guarantor under the Guarantee or you may receive a different security issued by the Guarantor (or another person) in place of the amount (if any) due to you under the Certificates by the Issuer, which may be worth significantly less than the amount due to you\nBNP Paribas is lead supervised by the ECB and the ACPR and is authorised by the ECB and the ACPR.
