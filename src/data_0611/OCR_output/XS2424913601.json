PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:\nThe Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Issuer and all payments, including the repayment of principal, are subject to the credit risk of the Issuer and the Guarantor. The Notes are not principal protected. The Notes are issued in USD and pay a pre- defined cash coupon on the relevant Interest Payment Date(s), including any previously missed coupon(s), minus the amount of coupons previously paid, if each Underlying is equal to or greater than the specified Coupon Barrier on the relevant Interest Determination Date. If, on any of the Early Redemption Observation Dates, each Underlying is equal to or greater than the Autocall Level, the Notes will automatically terminate and the investor will receive the Early Redemption Amount.\nThe Final Redemption Amount payable at maturity will depend on the performance of the Lowest Performing Underlying. If the price of the Lowest Performing Underlying on the Determination Date is equal to or greater than the Barrier Level, the Notes will return a cash amount equal to 100% of Par. Otherwise, the investor will receive a cash amount equal to the performance of the Lowest Performing Underlying calculated as the Final Reference Level divided by the Initial Reference Level.\nPRODUCT DETAILS:\nDATES:\nSSPA Code\n1260 \u2013 Conditional Coupon Barrier Reverse Convertible\nTrade Date\n28 February 2022\nISIN\nXS2424913601\nStrike Date\n28 February 2022\nValoren\n110605477\nIssue Date\n7 March 2022\nIssue Price\n100%\nDetermination Date\n28 February 2028\nPrincipal\nUSD 2,000,000\nMaturity Date\n6 March 2028\nThis is not an offer (or solicitation of an offer) to buy or sell the product.

No representation as to the tax consequences to any particular person is made hereby. Investors are advised to consult their own tax adviser in light of their particular circumstances as to the tax consequences of purchasing, holding or disposing of the products. Tax laws and tax doctrine may change, possibly with retroactive effect. Withholding tax and stamp duties\nThe product is not subject to Swiss withholding tax.\nPrimary market transactions concerning the product are not subject to Swiss stamp transfer tax. Secondary market transactions concerning the product are subject to Swiss stamp transfer tax if they are made by or through the intermediary of a Swiss bank or Swiss securities dealer and if no exemption applies. The cash redemptions of the product are not subject to Swiss stamp transfer tax.\nTax Treatment for Swiss resident individuals\nThis product is classified for Swiss tax purposes as a transparent non-Swiss bond-like derivative financial instrument with a predominantly one-time interest payment (\u201cObligationen-\u00e4hnliches Produkt mit \u00fcberwiegender Einmalverzinsung\u201d; IUP).\nAs a result, only the positive difference between the value of the bond floor (in CHF) at the redemption/disposal and the value of the bond floor (in CHF) at the issuance/acquisition of the product is taxable income at redemption/disposal date for Swiss resident individual investors (\u201cModifizierte Differenzbesteuerung\u201d). The remaining part of the return of the product is tax- free for Swiss resident individual investors holding the product for private investment purposes.\nA capital loss on the bond floor is only tax-deductible to the extent that it can be offset against gains/income of IUP products generated in the same calendar year; however, the capital loss on the bond floor generated by negative interest (if any) is not tax-deductible.\nThe tax information is a non-binding summary and only provides a general overview of the potential tax consequences linked to this Security at the time of issue. Tax laws and tax doctrine may change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Investors and prospective Investors are advised to consult with their tax advisers with respect to the Swiss tax consequences of the purchase, ownership, disposition, lapse or exercise or redemption of a Product in light of their particular circumstances. The Issuing Parties and the Lead Manager hereby expressly exclude any liability in respect of any possible tax implications. Updated bondfloor information, if a bondfloor is applicable to the Product (according to \u201cProduct Details\u201d and \u201cTaxation Switzerland\u201d herein), can be found on the following web page of the Swiss Federal Tax Administration (FTA): www.ictax.admin.ch\nB.

The potential loss of the Phoenix autocall note is 100% of the invested capital, should any of the relevant Underlying lose all of its value\nC. SIGNIFICANT RISKS FOR INVESTORS:\nRisk Factors\nPotential investors are urged to consult with their legal, regulatory, investment, accounting, tax and other advisors with regard to any proposed or actual investment in the Notes and to review the Offering Circular.\nPlease see the Offering Circular together with the Pricing Supplement for a full detailed description of the Notes and in particular, please review the Risk Factors associated with these Notes. Investing in the Notes entails certain risks including, but not limited to, the following:\nCapital is not protected: the final redemption amount depends on the performance of the Underlying and could be zero.\nAdjustments by the Determination Agent: The terms and conditions of the Notes will allow the Determination Agent to make adjustments or take any other appropriate action if circumstances occur where the Notes or any exchanges are affected by market disruption, adjustment events or circumstances affecting normal activities.\nIn addition, other circumstances may occur which either increase the liability of the Issuer fulfiling its obligations under the Notes or increase the liability of any hedging activities related to such obligations, including without limitation the adoption of or any change in any tax law relating to a common system of financial transaction tax in the European Union or otherwise.\nIn such circumstances, the Determination Agent can in its sole and absolute discretion determine whether to redeem the Notes early, or adjust the terms of the Notes, which may include without limitation adjustments to the Initial Reference Level, the Final Redemption Amount or the Underlying. The Determination Agent is not required but has the discretion to make adjustments with respect to each and every corporate action. Potential investors should see the Offering Circular for a detailed description of potential adjustment events and adjustments.\nAdministrator/Benchmark Event: The administrator or sponsor of an Underlying (or the Underlying itself) may be required to be authorised, registered, recognised, endorsed, the subject of an equivalence decision, approved or otherwise included in an official register in order for the Issuer or the Determination Agent to be permitted to use it and perform their respective obligations under the Notes. If the Determination Agent determines that such a requirement applies to the administrator or sponsor (or the Underlying) but it has not been satisfied then an \u201cAdministrator/Benchmark Event\u201d will occur and the Determination Agent or the Issuer may then apply certain fallbacks. These fallbacks may mean that the Determination Agent makes adjustments to the terms of the Notes, including substitution of the relevant Underlying with the \u2018Alternative Pre-nominated Index\u2019 (if any) specified for the Underlying,or to redeem the Notes.\nPotential investors should see the Offering Circular for a detailed description of what constitutes an Administrator/Benchmark Event and the applicable \u2018fallback\u2019 provisions that may apply if such event occurs.\nBasket Components Risk: The Notes will be redeemed at an amount determined by reference to the performance of the Basket Components and such performance will therefore affect the nature and value of the investment return on the Notes. Noteholders and prospective purchasers of Notes should conduct their own investigations and, in deciding whether or not to purchase Notes, prospective purchasers should form their own views of the merits of an investment related to the Basket Components based upon such investigations and not in reliance on any information given in this document.\nExit Risk: Any secondary market price of the Notes will depend on many factors, including the value and volatility of the Underlying(s), interest rates, the dividend rate on the stocks that compose the Underlying (if any), time remaining to maturity and the creditworthiness of the Issuer and the Guarantor. The secondary market price may be lower than the market value of the issued Notes as at the Issue Date to take into account amounts paid to distributors and other intermediaries relating to the issue and sale of the Notes as well as amounts relating to the hedging of the Issuer's obligations. As a result of all of these factors, the holder may receive an amount in the secondary market which may be less than the then intrinsic market value of the Security and which may also be less than the amount the holder would have received had the holder held the Security through to maturity.\nThis is not an offer (or solicitation of an offer) to buy or sell the product. The product may not be offered, sold, transferred or delivered directly or indirectly in the United States to, or for the account or benefit of, any U.S. Person (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act). Please refer to the important information at the end of this term sheet. \u00a9 Copyright 2022 Morgan Stanley.\nGlobal ID: XS2424913601\nMorgan Stanley\nCredit Risk: Investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Issuer and/or Guarantor. The Notes are essentially a loan to the Issuer with a repayment amount linked to the performance of the Underlying that the Issuer promises to pay at maturity and that the Guarantor promises to pay if the Issuer fails to do so. There is the risk, however, that the Issuer and the Guarantor may not be able to fulfil their obligations, irrespective of whether the Notes are referred to as capital or principal protected. Investors may lose all or part of their investment if the Issuer and the Guarantor are unable to pay the coupons (if any) or the redemption amount. No assets of the Issuer and/or Guarantor are segregated and specifically set aside in order to pay the holders of the Notes in the event of liquidation of the Issuer and/or Guarantor, and the holders of the Notes will rank behind secured or preferred creditors.\nLiquidity Risk: Any secondary market in the Notes made by the Dealer or its affiliates will be made on a reasonable efforts basis only and subject to market conditions, law, regulation and internal policy. Even whilst there may be a secondary market in the Notes it may not be liquid enough to facilitate a sale by the holders.\nProduct Market Risk: The value of the Notes and the returns available under the terms of the Notes will be influenced and dependent on the value of the Underlying. It is impossible to predict how the level of the Underlying will vary over time. The historical performance (if any) of the Underlying is not indicative of its future performance.\nHedging Risk: On or prior to and after the Trade Date, the Issuer, through its affiliates or others, will likely hedge its anticipated exposure under the Notes by taking positions in the Underlying, in option contracts on the Underlying or positions in any other available securities or instruments. In addition, the Issuer and its affiliates trade the Underlying as part of their general businesses.\nAdjustment and Discontinuation Risk: The Sponsor of the Underlying can add, delete or substitute stocks constituting the Underlying or make other methodological changes that could change the value of the Underlying without regard to the interests of holders of the Notes. Any of these decisions/determinations may adversely affect the value of the Notes and may result in the investor receiving a return that is materially different from what he/she would have received if the event had not occurred\nNo Shareholder Rights: A holder of Notes will have no beneficial interest in the stocks that compose the relevant Underlying nor any voting rights and will not have the right to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the stocks that compose the Underlying.\nUnderlying Sponsor Risk: The sponsor of the relevant Underlying is not an affiliate of the Issuer or its affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way. Consequently, the Issuer and the Determination Agent have no ability to control the actions of the sponsor of the relevant Underlying, including and rebalancing that could trigger an adjustment to the terms of the Notes by the Determination Agent.\nPotential Conflict of Interest: The Determination Agent, which is an affiliate of the Issuer, will determine the payout to the investor at maturity. Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc and its affiliates may trade the Underlying on a regular basis as part of its general broker-dealer business and may also carry out hedging activities in relation to the Notes. Any of these activities could influence the Determination Agent\u2019s determination of adjustments made to any Notes and any such trading activity could potentially affect the price of the Underlying and, accordingly, could affect the investor\u2019s payout on any Note.\nD. Selling Restrictions\nNo public offer or subsequent distribution of the Notes in any Member State of the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom is permitted.\nThis term sheet may not be used for the purpose of any offer or solicitation by anyone in any jurisdiction in which that offer or solicitation is not authorized or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such an offer or solicitation. No offer of the Notes to the public may be made, except in circumstances which do not result in any breach of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the \u201cProspectus Regulation\u201d) by the Issuer, the Dealer and their respective affiliates and for this purpose an offer shall not be treated as not requiring the publication of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation solely by virtue of the application of Article 1(4)(b) (offer to fewer than 150 persons).\nThe Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Notes Act of 1933, as amended, or the securities laws of any State in the United States, and are subject to U.S. tax requirements. The Notes may not be offered, sold or delivered at any time, directly or indirectly, within the United States (which term includes the territories, the possessions and all other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States of America) or to or for the account of a U.S. Person (as defined in Regulation S under the Notes Act of 1933, as amended). In purchasing the Notes, you represent and warrant that you are neither located in the United States nor a U.S. Person and that you are not purchasing for the account or benefit of any such person.\nSwiss Offer Restrictions\nThis is not an offer (or solicitation of an offer) to buy or sell the product.
