BNP Paribas gives no assurance that any Certificate will be issued or any transaction will be entered into on the basis of these indicative terms. The information contained in this document is provided to you on a strictly confidential basis and you agree that it may not be distributed by you to other parties or potential purchasers of Certificates other than with our prior written consent and in compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations in force in the jurisdiction(s) in which you offer the Securities described in this document. If you have received a copy of this document from anyone other than BNP Paribas, it will not contain all the information required for you to assess its contents. This document is not intended for any Retail Client, as defined in Directive 2004/39/EC (\"MiFID\") and the relevant implementing measures in any EU member state.\n",
      "No action has been or will be taken in any jurisdiction that would, or is intended to, permit a public offering of the Certificates. The Certificates are sold to investors on the understanding that they will comply with all relevant securities laws and public offer requirements in the jurisdictions in which the Certificates are placed or resold, including, without limitation, Directive 2003/71/EC (the EU Prospectus Directive) as amended (which includes the amendments made by Directive 2010/73/EU the \"2010 PD Amending Directive\") and the relevant implementing measures in any EU member state. Where the investor of the Certificates is not the only purchaser of the Certificates, any public offer exemption relying solely on offers only being made to a restricted number of investors (classified by type or location, as applicable) may not be available.\n",

The Certificates have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the securities laws of any state in the United States, and are subject to U.S. tax requirements.

The Certificates may not be offered, sold, transferred or delivered without compliance with all applicable securities laws and regulations.\n",
      "Investors should note that BNP Paribas acting as Guarantor is licensed as a credit institution in France and as such is subject to the new resolution regime introduced by the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive of 15 May 2014. This new regulation, among others, gives resolution authorities the power to amend the key terms of the Guarantee, to reduce the amounts payable by the Guarantor under the terms of the Guarantee (including a reduction to zero) and convert the amounts due under the Guarantee into shares or other securities. You may not be able to recover all or even part of the amount due under the Certificates (if any) from the Guarantor under the Guarantee or you may receive a different security issued by the Guarantor (or another person) in place of the amount (if any) due to you under the Certificates by the Issuer, which may be worth significantly less than the amount due to you under the Certificates at expiry.\n",
      "Risk Analysis\n",
      "The Securities have no capital protection at any time and there can be a partial or total loss of any capital invested. Investment in the Securities is therefore highly speculative and should only be considered by persons who can afford to lose their entire investment.\n",
      "BNP Paribas is not providing the recipients of this document with any investment advice or recommendation to enter into any potential transaction. Any purchaser of Certificates, other than a BNP Paribas counterparty or distributor, will be purchasing the Certificates from such counterparty or distributor and will have no contractual relationship with BNP Paribas or any of its affiliates. In particular BNP Paribas will not be responsible for assessing the appropriateness or suitability of an investment in the Certificates in relation to such third parties. This document should be read together with the Base Prospectus and the applicable Final Terms for the Certificates. Any proposed issuance described in this document cannot be fully assessed without a careful review of the terms and conditions contained in the Base Prospectus and the Final Terms. In particular, potential investors should carefully read the sections headed \"Risk Factors\" in the Base Prospectus and the Final Terms for a full description of the potential risks associated with the Certificates, and \"Offering and Sale\", for certain limitations on the purchase and onward sales of the Certificates.\n",
      "Any indicative price quotations, investment cases or market analysis contained in this document or any related marketing materials we may have provided to you have been prepared on assumptions and parameters that reflect our good faith judgement or selection but must be subject to your own independent analysis and due diligence before you make any investment decision. Please note that there can be conflicts of interests between BNP Paribas and potential investors (see below) and we can therefore not assume any responsibility for the financial consequences of your investment decision, which must be independent. We require that you undertake your own independent due diligence and avail yourself of your own advisors in order to assess the suitability of Certificates in relation to your own financial objectives. Accordingly, if you decide to purchase Certificates, you will be deemed to understand and accept the terms, conditions and risks associated with the Certificates. You will also be deemed to act for your own account, to have made your own independent decision to purchase the Certificates and to declare that such transaction is appropriate for you based upon your own judgement the advice from such advisers as you have deemed necessary to consult.
