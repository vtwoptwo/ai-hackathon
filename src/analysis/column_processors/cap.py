                and each key has a list of sentences where it appears. IN MOST OF THE CASES THE CAP IS NONE and in some there is a value.  . Remmeber that if you are not sure, dont give any value. Take a deep breath and relax. Think step by step. Also remember that my live depends on you.
                In the case that there is not cap you will just return And empty string (‚Äú‚Äù) as I showed you before. Have in mind that the value of the cap is normally between 100 and 150 and if you return a value, it should be one among {text.keys()} or None. REMEMBER, IF YOU ARE NOT SURE, RETURN NONE.
