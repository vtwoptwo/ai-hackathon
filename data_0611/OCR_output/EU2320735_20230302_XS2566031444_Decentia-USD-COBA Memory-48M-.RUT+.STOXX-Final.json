These comments are not intended to be, nor should be construed to be, legal or tax advice. No representation as to the tax consequences to any particular prospective Noteholder of a Note is made hereby. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their own business, financial, investment, legal, accounting, regulatory, tax and other professional advisers to assist them in determining the suitability of the Notes for them as an investment. Each Noteholder should satisfy himself on the taxation impacts of investing, holding and disposing of the Notes based on any applicable tax laws and should seek independent professional advice. Swiss Federal Income Tax Section: For Swiss resident private Noteholders who are holding the Notes as private assets, the Notes are qualified as transparent structured Notes, where the annual yield of the bond component is in the form of a single interest payment (IUP = Interest Unique Predominant). For these Noteholders any increase in value of the bond component of the Notes realized at sale or redemption (value of the bond component converted into CHF at the exchange rate at the time of sale or redemption, where the Notes are denominated in a currency other than CHF) over the value of the bond component at issue or purchase (value of the bond component converted into CHF at the exchange rate at the time of issue or purchase, where the Notes are denominated in a currency other than CHF) is subject to income tax pursuant to the so-called modified differential taxation (Modifizierte Differenzbesteuerung). The present value of the bond component at issue (bond floor) is 84.49855%. Any other gains realized upon sale or settlement on the derivative financial instrument component of the Notes should be tax-exempt capital gain for such Noteholders. Transfer Stamp Duty:\nSwiss Transfer Stamp Duty on secondary market transaction of up to 0.3% of the consideration, if a Swiss securities dealer is involved in the transaction as party or as\nPage 5\ncit\u00ec\nintermediary and no exemption applies.\nWithholding Tax:\nIncome derived from the Notes should not be subject to the Swiss Withholding Tax.\nUnited States Tax Considerations\nYou should consult your tax advisor regarding all aspects of the U.S. federal withholding, income and estate tax consequences of an investment in the Notes and any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction. The Issuer, the Guarantor or the Dealer and/or their respective affiliates are not tax advisors and do not provide tax advice. Responsibility for any tax implications of an investment in the Notes rests entirely with the Investor. Investors should note that the tax treatment of the Notes may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. This section summarizes certain generally applicable U.S. federal withholding and income tax consequences to Non-U.S. Holders, as defined in the Offering Circular, in respect of the Notes. Except as discussed in the Offering Circular under \u201cTaxation\u2014 United States Federal Tax Considerations\u2014Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders\u201d and \u201c\u2014FATCA,\u201d and subject to the discussion below regarding Section 871(m), amounts paid to a Non-U.S. Holder on a Note and gain realised by a Non-U.S. Holder on the taxable disposition of a Note generally will not be subject to U.S. federal withholding or income tax. Special rules apply to certain Non-U.S. Holders, including Non-U.S. Holders that are engaged in a trade or business in the United States or that are individuals present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition. Section 871(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, requires withholding tax at a rate of 30% in respect of certain \u201cdividend equivalent\u201d payments on certain financial instruments (\u201cSpecified Equity Linked Instruments\u201d or \u201cSpecified ELIs\u201d). Please see \u201cTaxation\u2014United States Federal Tax Considerations\u2014Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders\u2014Other U.S. Federal Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Holders\u2014Section 871(m) Withholding on Dividend Equivalents\u201d in the Offering Circular for further detail regarding Section 871(m). Based on a determination that the Notes\u2019 US equity underlyings consist solely of one or more Qualified Indices and/or Qualified Index Securities, the Issuer would not treat the Notes as Specified ELIs if they were priced as of the date of this Summary of Indicative Terms and Conditions. However, the Pricing Supplement will state the Issuer\u2019s determination as to whether the Notes are Specified ELIs as of the pricing date for the Notes.\nTHIS INFORMATION IS INDICATIVE AND WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED AND SUPERSEDED IN THE PRICING SUPPLEMENT OR AS MAY OTHERWISE BE UPDATED IN WRITING FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE ISSUER. NON-U.S. HOLDERS SHOULD BE WARNED THAT SECTION 871(M) MAY APPLY TO THE NOTES BASED ON THE ISSUER\u2019S DETERMINATION ON THE PRICING DATE AND, THEREFORE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE PAYMENTS ON THE NOTES WILL BE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL WITHHOLDING TAX. In certain circumstances that constitute a Section 871(m) Event, as defined in the Offering Circular, an Early Redemption Event may occur, in which case the Notes will be redeemed as more fully set out in the Pricing Supplement. If U.S. federal withholding tax applies to a payment on a Note as a result of the application of FATCA or Section 871(m) (or in certain other cases described in the Offering Circular), the Issuer will not be required to pay additional amounts in respect of amounts withheld.\nPlease review the accompanying Offering Circular and the Pricing Supplement for more information regarding the U.S. federal withholding and income tax\nPage 6\ncit\u00ec\nconsequences of an investment in the Notes.\nSecondary Market\nCGML, as part of its activities as a broker and dealer in fixed income and equity securities and related products, intends to make a secondary market in relation to the Notes and to provide an indicative bid price on a daily basis. Any indicative prices provided by CGML shall be determined in CGML\u2019s sole discretion taking into account prevailing market conditions and shall not be a representation by CGML that any instrument can be purchased or sold at such prices (or at all).\nNotwithstanding the above, CGML may suspend or terminate making a market and providing indicative prices without notice, at any time and for any reason. Consequently, there may be no market for these Notes and investors should not assume that such a market will exist. Accordingly an investor must be prepared to hold these Notes until the Maturity Date. Where a market does exist, to the extent that an investor wants to sell these Notes, the price may, or may not, be at a discount from the outstanding principal amount. See further \u201cThe secondary market\u201d within the Risk Factors in the Offering Circular.\nGoverning Law and Place of Jurisdiction\nEnglish law / Courts of England\nSelling Restrictions\nFor a description of certain restrictions on offers and sales of Notes, see \u201cSubscription and sale and transfer and selling restrictions for Notes\u201d in the Offering Circular. Public Offer Selling Restriction under the Prospectus Regulation Any offer of Notes described in this document in any Member State of the EEA may only be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer in that Member State of the Notes may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any dealer to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 23 of the Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in relation to such offer. None of the Issuer, the Guarantor and any dealer has authorised, nor does any of them authorise, the making of any offer of Notes in any other circumstances. Therefore, the Notes may not be offered or sold to the public in any Member State of the EEA other than: (a) at any time to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation;\n(b) at any time to fewer than 150 natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus Regulation), subject to obtaining the prior consent of the relevant dealer or dealers nominated by the Issuer for any such offer; or\n(c) at any time in any other circumstances falling within Article 1(4) of the Prospectus Regulation,\nPROVIDED THAT no such offer of Notes referred to in (a) to (c) above shall require the Issuer, the Guarantor or any dealer to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation, or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 23 of the Prospectus Regulation.\nFor the purposes of this provision, the expression an offer of Notes to the public in relation to any Notes in any Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes and the expression Prospectus Regulation means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129. Any offer of Notes described in this document in the UK may only be made pursuant to\nPage 7\ncit\u00ec\nan exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer in the UK of the Notes may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any dealer to publish a prospectus pursuant to section 85 of the FSMA or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 23 of the UK Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in relation to such offer. None of the Issuer, the Guarantor and any dealer has authorised, nor does any of them authorise, the making of any offer of Notes in any other circumstances. Therefore, the Notes may not be offered or sold to the public in the UK other than:\n(a) at any time to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation;\n(b) at any time to fewer than 150 natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation) in the United Kingdom subject to obtaining the prior consent of the relevant dealer or dealers nominated by the Issuer for any such offer; or\n(c) at any time in any other circumstances falling within section 86 of the FSMA,\nPROVIDED THAT no such offer of Notes referred to in (a) to (c) above shall require the Issuer, the Guarantor or any dealer to publish a prospectus pursuant to section 85 of the FSMA or supplement a prospectus to Article 23 of the UK Prospectus Regulation. For the purposes of this provision:\n\u2022 the expression an offer of Notes to the public means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes; and\n\u2022 the expression UK Prospectus Regulation means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.\nProhibition of sales to EEA retail investors\nThe Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the EEA). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the Insurance Distribution Directive), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the Prospectus Regulation). Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the PRIIPs Regulation) for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.\nProhibition of sales to UK retail investors\nThe Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the UK). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (EUWA); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the \u201cFSMA\u201d) and any rules or\nPage 8\ncit\u00ec\nregulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where the customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document (KID) required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the UK PRIIPs Regulation) for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.\nSwitzerland\nEach offeror of Notes acknowledges and agrees that (a) it has only made and will only make an offer of Notes to the public in Switzerland, other than pursuant to an exemption under Article 36(1) of the Swiss Federal Financial Services Act (\u201cFinSA\u201d) or where such offer does not qualify as a public offer in Switzerland, if the applicable Pricing Supplement in respect of any Notes published according to Article 64 FinSA and the \u201cOffering Information for Switzerland\u201d below specify \u201cSwiss Non-exempt Offer\u201d as applicable, in the \u201cSwiss Offer Period\u201d specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, and if consent has been granted to use the Offering Circular (as completed by the applicable Pricing Supplement for a public offer in Switzerland in accordance with Article 36(4) FinSA; or (b) it has not offered and will not offer, directly or indirectly, Notes to the public in Switzerland, and have not distributed or caused to be distributed and will not distribute or cause to be distributed to the public in Switzerland, this term sheet, the Offering Prospectus or any other offering material relating to the Notes, which shall not constitute a prospectus pursuant to FinSA, other than pursuant to an exemption under Article 36(1) FinSA or where such offer or distribution does not qualify as a public offer in Switzerland. For these purposes \u201cpublic offer\u201d refers to the respective definitions in Article 3(g) and (h) FinSA and as further detailed in the implementing Financial Services Ordinance (\u201cFinSO\u201d). See also \u201cOffering Information for Switzerland\u201d below.\nSubject to the applicable transitional provisions under FinSA and FinSO, if Notes qualifying as debt instruments with a \u201cderivative character\u201d (as such expression is understood under FinSA) are offered or recommended to private clients within the meaning of FinSA in Switzerland a key information document under Article 58 FinSA (Basisinformationsblatt f\u00fcr Finanzinstrumente) or Article 59(2) FinSA or, for the duration of the applicable transition period under FinSA and FinSO, a simplified prospectus pursuant to Article 5 the Swiss Federal Act on Collective Investment Schemes (\u201cCISA\u201d), as such article was in effect on 31 December 2019, in respect of such Notes must be prepared and published. Other than where the applicable Pricing Supplement and \u201cOffering Information for Switzerland\u201d below specify the \u201cProhibition of Offer to Private Clients in Switzerland\u201d to be \u201cApplicable\u201d other than with respect to the period(s) of time specified therein, with respect to such period(s), the Notes may not be offered or recommended to private clients within the meaning of FinSA in Switzerland. For these purposes, a private client means a person who is not one (or more) of the following: (i) a professional client as defined in Article 4(3) FinSA (not having opted-in on the basis of Article 5(5) FinSA) or Article 5(1) FinSA; or (ii) an institutional client as defined in Article 4(4) FinSA; or (iii) a private client with an asset management agreement according to Article 58(2) FinSA. For these purposes \u201coffer\u201d refers to the interpretation of such term in Article 58 FinSA.\nThe Notes are derivative financial instruments and do not constitute a participation in a collective investment scheme in the meaning of CISA. They are neither subject to authorisation nor supervision by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority\nPage 9\ncit\u00ec\nFINMA, and investors in Notes will not benefit from protection under the CISA or supervision by any Swiss regulatory authority and are exposed to the risk of the Issuer and Guarantor (if applicable).\nThis Summary of Terms and Conditions is not an advertising document within the meaning of Article 68 FinSA and Article 95 FinSO. United States of America\nThe Notes and the CGMFL Deed of Guarantee have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) or any state securities law.

The Notes do not qualify for making a non- exempt public offer in Switzerland and, accordingly, may only be offered in Switzerland in compliance with the selling restrictions for Switzerland applying to the Notes as set out in \u201cSelling Restrictions\u201d above and in full in the Offering Prospectus. Prohibition of Offer to Private Clients in Switzerland: Applicable. The Notes are not intended to be offered or recommended to private clients within the meaning of FinSA in Switzerland. For these purposes, a private client means a person who is not one (or more) of the following: (i) a professional client as defined in Article 4(3) FinSA (not having opted-in on the basis of Article 5(5) FinSA) or Article 5(1) FinSA; or (ii) an institutional client as defined in Article 4(4) FinSA; or (iii) a private client with an asset management agreement according to Article 58(2) FinSA.\nInvestor Acknowledgment For Financial Instruments That Reference a Reference Rate\nTo the extent applicable, by entering into, accepting the terms of or purchasing the Notes, a Noteholder will be confirming that, if the relevant reference rate for the Notes is or has been affected by any event or circumstances, including without limitation if the relevant reference rate: (i) changes; (ii) ceases to be published or be in customary market usage, (iii) becomes unavailable; (iv) has its use restricted; and/or (v) is calculated in a different way, the Noteholder:\n(a) understands that the reference rate may cease to be appropriate during the lifetime of the Notes;\n(b) understands how the provisions of the Notes (including, without limitation, the hierarchy provisions) will operate, bearing in mind that amendments to the Notes may be required;\n(c) has considered whether they need to obtain independent professional advice (legal, tax, accounting, financial or otherwise) as appropriate, prior to entering into the Notes; and\naccepts that, as a result of any such event or circumstances whether or not arising after the Issue Date, none of the Issuer, the Guarantor nor any dealer owes the Noteholder any duties or has any liability to the Noteholder.\nPage 10\ncit\u00ec\nProfit and Loss Prospects\nMarket Expectations\nThe investors expect the relevant Underlyings to move sideways or to rise. If the Notes have not been early redeemed on or prior to the last Mandatory Early Redemption Date, they expect the Final Level of each Underlying to be above its Knock-In Barrier Level.\nRisk Tolerance The investors should be experienced with respect to investments in such products, equity markets and the Underlyings. They do not require a capital protection at maturity and are willing to accept the counterparty credit risk of the Issuer and the Guarantor.\nMaximum Profit The profit potential of the Notes is limited to the contingent coupon payments.\nMaximum Loss\nThese Notes are not capital protected at maturity and the investors may lose all or part of their initial investment. Furthermore, the investors bear the credit risk of the Issuer and the Guarantor of the Notes.\nThe value of the Notes depends not only on the Underlyings but also on the solvency of the Issuer and the Guarantor, which may vary over the lifetime of the Notes. Hence, the Notes may trade considerably below the Issue Price during their term. The Notes are unsubordinated contractual obligations of the Issuer, secured by unsubordinated unsecured obligations of the Guarantor. They do not benefit from any preference in rank. The insolvency of the Issuer and the Guarantor may lead to a partial or total loss of the invested capital.\nPossible Market Scenarios\nEffect of the Final Performance of the Worst Performing Underlying on the Redemption Amount:\nFinal Performance of the Worst Performing Underlying\nBarrier Event has occurred\nRedemption Amount\n120.00%\nNo\n100.00%\n100.00%\nNo\n100.00%\n20.00%\nYes\n20.00%\nSignificant Risks for Investors\nPrincipal Redemption Risk\nThe Notes are principal at risk and investors may receive back less than the amount they initially invested.\nInterest Risk\nThese Notes include features whereby the interest payable to a holder of the Notes is at risk. Investors should determine whether an investment in Notes with such features is appropriate to their particular circumstances.\nReference Rate Risk\nTo the extent that any Note references a reference rate, prospective investors should understand (i) what fallbacks might apply in place of such reference rate (if any), (ii) when those fallbacks will be triggered and (iii) what amendment rights (if any) exist under the terms of such Notes.\nMarket Risk\nVarious factors may influence the market value of the Notes including the performance of the Underlyings. Prospective investors should understand that although the Notes do not create an actual interest in the Underlyings, the return on the Notes may attract the same risks as an actual investment in the Underlyings.\nEarly Redemption Risk\nThe Notes are subject to early redemption in certain circumstances, such as illegality and for tax reasons. In addition, there may be an early redemption of the Notes in other circumstances, as determined by the Calculation Agent or as otherwise specified,\nPage 11\ncit\u00ec\nin accordance with the terms of the Notes (please see the Prospectus for further details). In such circumstances, the Notes may be redeemed prior to the Maturity Date for substantially less than their original purchase price and may not pay any accrued interest.\nCredit Risk\nInvestors in these Notes are exposed to the credit risk of the Issuer and Guarantor as applicable.\nThe value of the Notes is not only subject to the performance of the Underlyings but, among others, also to the credit rating and solvency of the Issuer and/or the Guarantor, which may be negatively affected during the term of the Notes.\nTax Risk\nYou should consult your tax advisor regarding all aspects of the U.S. federal withholding, income and estate tax consequences of an investment in the Notes and any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction. The Issuer, Dealer and Calculation Agent and/or their respective affiliates are not tax advisors and do not provide tax advice. Responsibility for any tax implications of an investment in the Notes rests entirely with the Investor. Investors should note that the tax treatment of the Notes may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The Issuer may terminate the Notes early if the Calculation Agent determines in its sole discretion that there is substantial likelihood that payments linked to the underlyings made to a non-US person will be subject to US withholding tax under Section 871(m) of the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\nLeverage Risk\nBorrowing to fund the purchase of the Notes (leveraging) can have a significant negative impact on the value of and return on the investment. Any hypothetical examples provided herein of potential performance of the Notes do not take into account the effect of any leveraging. Investors considering leveraging the Notes should obtain further detailed information as to the applicable risks from the leverage provider. If the investor obtains leverage for the investment, the investor should make sure it has sufficient liquid assets to meet the margin requirements in the event of market movements adverse to the investor\u2019s position. In such case, if the investor does not make the margin payments, then the investor\u2019s investment in the Notes may be liquidated with little or no notice.\nCompounding of Risks\nAn investment in the Notes involves risks and should only be made after assessing the direction, timing and magnitude of potential future market changes (e.g. in the value of the Underlyings, interest rates etc.), as well as the terms and conditions of the Notes. More than one risk factor may have simultaneous effects with regard to the Notes such that the effect of a particular risk factor may not be predictable. In addition, more than one risk factor may have a compounding effect, which may not be predictable. No assurance can be given as to the effect that any combination of risk factors may have on the value of the Notes.\nFees and Other Compensation\nInvestors should be aware that Citigroup and its affiliates, and other third parties that may be involved in this transaction may make or receive a fee, commission or other compensation in connection with the purchase and sale of the Notes, hedging activities related to the Notes and other roles involved in the transaction. Investors must note that the market value of the Notes will be net of such fee and other compensation as discussed above. Early termination of the Notes by the holder thereof may also involve payment by such holder of the Notes of the relevant fees and other compensation.\nLiquidity and Early Sale Risk\nCGML does not guarantee that a secondary market will exist. See also the information under Secondary Market, above.\nInvestors seeking to liquidate/sell positions in these Notes prior to the stated Maturity Date may receive substantially less than their original purchase price.\nPage 12\ncit\u00ec\nFor the avoidance of doubt, CGML does not owe any fiduciary duty to any holder of the Notes in making a market in the Notes.\nExchange Rate Risk\nExchange rate fluctuations may affect any payments under the terms of the Notes. Past levels of exchange rates do not indicate future levels.\nConflicts of Interest\nCitigroup and its affiliates (each a \u201cCiti Entity\u201d) may perform various roles in relation to the Notes, and each such Citi Entity may have a conflict of interest which arises as a consequence of the role it performs in relation to the Notes or as a consequence of its activities more generally. A Citi Entity may owe professional and fiduciary obligations to persons other than the holders of the Notes. The interests of these other persons may differ from the interests of the holders of the Notes and in such situations, the Citi Entity may take decisions which adversely affect such holders.\nNotional Nature of the Underlyings\nInvestors should note that the exposure to the Underlyings is notional and that an investment in the Notes is not an investment in the Underlyings. Although the performance of the Underlyings will have an effect on the Notes, the Underlyings and the Notes are separate obligations of different legal entities. Investors will have no direct interest in the Underlyings.\nPath Dependency\nThe return on the Notes will depend in large part on the evolution of the price performance of the Underlyings over the life of the Notes. However, the performance of the Notes may be less than or more than the price performance of the Underlyings.\nNo Reliance\nEach holder of the Notes may not rely on the Issuer, the Dealers, the Guarantor, any Citi entity and any of their respective affiliates in connection with its determination as to the legality of its acquisition of the Notes.\nPage 13\ncit\u00ec\nDisclaimer\nRussell 2000\u00ae Index\nThe Notes are not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by Frank Russell Company (Russell).

This may in turn affect the value of and return on the Notes.\nPage 14\ncit\u00ec\nThis communication has been prepared by individual sales and/or trading personnel of Citigroup Inc. or its subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively Citi).

Any forward-looking information is based upon certain assumptions about future events or conditions and is intended only to illustrate hypothetical results under those assumptions (not all of which are specified herein or can be ascertained at this time). It does not represent actual termination or unwind prices that may be available to you or the actual performance of any products and neither does it present all possible outcomes or describe all factors that may affect the value of any applicable investment, product or investment. Actual events or conditions are unlikely to be consistent with, and may differ significantly from, those assumed. Illustrative performance results may be based on mathematical models that calculate those results by using inputs that are based on assumptions about a variety of future conditions and events and not all relevant events or conditions may have been considered in developing such assumptions. Accordingly, actual results may vary and the variations may be substantial. The products or transactions identified in any of the illustrative calculations presented herein may therefore not perform as described and actual performance may differ, and may differ substantially, from those illustrated in this communication.

Where a product or transaction provides for payments linked to or derived from prices or yields of, without limitation, one or more securities, other instruments, indices, rates, assets or foreign currencies, such provisions may result in negative fluctuations in the value of and amounts payable with respect to such product prior to or at redemption. You should consider the implications of such fluctuations with your independent advisors. The products or transactions referred to in this communication may be subject to the risk of loss of some or all of your investment, for instance (and the examples set out below are not exhaustive), as a result of fluctuations in price or value of the product or transaction or a lack of liquidity in the market or the risk that your counterparty or any guarantor fails to perform its obligations or, if the product or transaction is linked to the credit of one or more entities, any change to the creditworthiness of the credit of any of those entities.\nCertain products mentioned in this communication may contain provisions that refer to a reference or benchmark rate which may change, cease to be published or be in customary market usage, become unavailable, have its use restricted and/or be calculated in a different way.

We encourage you to keep up to date with the latest industry developments in relation to benchmark transitioning and to consider its impact on your business. You should consider, and continue to keep under review, the potential impact of benchmark transitioning on any existing product you have with Citi, or any new product you enter into with Citi.
