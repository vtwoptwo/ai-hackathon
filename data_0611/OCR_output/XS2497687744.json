This summary does not address the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes in any other jurisdiction than Switzerland. Because this summary does not address all tax considerations under Swiss law and does not consider the specific tax situation of an investor, prospective investors are recommended to consult its personal tax advisors as to the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership, sale or redemption of the Notes including, in particular, the effect of tax laws of any other jurisdiction. An investor shall be liable for all current and future taxes and duties resulting from an investment in the Notes.\nA) Swiss Income Taxation\nPlease note that the following income tax treatment is only applicable for private investors with tax residence in Switzerland, holding the Notes as their private assets in a tax perspective.\nThe Interest rate component of the Interest Amount is subject to income tax on the relevant Payment Date. However, the Option premium component is in principle not subject to income tax.\nB) Swiss Withholding Tax\nThe Notes are not subject to Swiss withholding tax.\nC) Swiss Stamp Taxes\nFor Swiss stamp duty purpose, the Notes are treated as analogous to a foreign bond. Therefore, the issuance (primary market) is not subject to Swiss stamp duty. However, secondary market transactions are in principle subject to Swiss stamp duty (TK 22).\nThe before mentioned tax treatment applies at the Issue Date. The relevant tax laws and/or the regulation and practice of the tax authorities may change at any time. Please note that this tax information does not replace professional tax advice from a personal tax advisor considering the particular circumstances of a holder or a prospective holder.\nRBC Europe Limited Registered in England and Wales: 995939\nRBC Europe Limited Registered Address: 100 Bishopsgate London EC2N 4AA\nAuthorised by the Prudential Regulatory Authority (\"PRA\") and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") and the PRA\n4 / 12\nTherefore, Royal Bank of Canada highly recommends consulting the personal tax advisor as to the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership, sale or exercise of these Notes. Royal Bank of Canada hereby expressly excludes any liabilities in respect of any tax implications arising thereof.\nAutomatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters\nSwitzerland has implemented the Automatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters (\"AEOI\") as of 1st January 2017 with the EU and various other countries and is negotiating the introduction of the AEOI with further countries. The website \"www.sif.admin.ch\" provides an overview of all partner states Switzerland has signed an agreement for the introduction of the AEOI.\nII. PROFIT AND LOSS\nPROFIT AND LOSS\nThis security falls in the category \u201cparticipation\u201d.\nThere is however an upper limit to the profit investors may realize. The maximum amount investors may receive over the term of the security is their invested capital, excluding any transaction or other costs, plus participation in the performance of the Reference Item, subject to a maximum return at maturity of 130.00%.\nOn the downside, investors are exposed to the negative development of the Reference Item. This could lead to a partial or even a total loss of investment.\nPlease refer to the section \u201cProduct Description\u201d.\nEffect of the performance of the Reference Item on the redemption amount:\nPositive performance:\nIf the Reference Item performs positively, the investor realises a positive return.\nSideways to slightly negative performance:\nIf the Reference Item performs sideways to slightly negative, the investor realises no return or a slightly negative return.\nPronounced negative performance:\nIf the Reference Item performs negatively, the investor realises negative return.\nIII. SIGNIFICANT RISKS FOR INVESTORS\nRISKS\nProduct Risk\nThese Securities are capital at risk. This means there is a risk that you could lose your entire investment or part of it. These Securities are not guaranteed against losses by the Issuer, Dealer, their affiliates, the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme or any equivalent European deposit guarantee scheme.\nU.S. Withholding Tax on Dividend Equivalent Payments\nThe United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, treats a \u201cdividend equivalent\u201d payment as a dividend from sources within the United States. Unless reduced by an applicable tax treaty with the United States, such payments generally would be subject to U.S. withholding tax of 30% if paid to a non-U.S. holder. A non- U.S. holder is a beneficial owner of a Note that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is a non-resident alien individual, a foreign corporation, or a foreign estate or trust. Under recently finalized U.S. Treasury Department regulations, payments on certain equity-linked instruments (including deemed payments) that are contingent upon or determined by Reference to actual or estimated U.S. source dividends, (regardless of whether such contingency or determination is explicitly stated or implicitly taken into account in computing one or more of the terms of such instruments) may be treated as dividend equivalents subject to withholding tax. Withholding tax will apply to dividend\nRBC Europe Limited Registered in England and Wales: 995939 RBC Europe Limited Registered Address: 100 Bishopsgate London EC2N 4AA\nAuthorised by the Prudential Regulatory Authority (\"PRA\") and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") and the PRA\n5 / 12\nequivalent payments on Notes issued or materially modified on or after January 1, 2017. If any payments are treated as dividend equivalent subject to withholding, we (or the applicable paying agent) would be required to withhold taxes and would not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld. Prospective investors of the Notes should consult their own tax advisers regarding the application of the U.S. rules for withholding on dividend equivalents.\nIssuer Risk\nInvestors bear the issuer risk. The Security\u2019s value and the payment of any income or bonus amount (where one is payable) are dependent not only on the development of the Reference Item, but also on the creditworthiness of the Issuer, which may vary over the term of the Security. The ratings of the Issuer noted above reflect the independent opinion of the rating agencies as to the safety of payments of principal and interest. These ratings are not a guarantee of credit quality. The ratings do not take into consideration any risk associated with fluctuations in the market value of this Security, or where factors other than the Issuer\u2019s credit quality determine the level of principal and interest payments.\nReference Item\nThe value of the Security is linked to the Reference Item(s). The past performance of the Reference Item(s) is not an indication or guarantee of future performance. Any decision to invest in the Securities should not be based solely or primarily on the past performance of the Reference Item(s). The performance of the Reference Item(s) may be volatile and subject to unpredictable changes over the term of the Security. The investor should be prepared to assume this risk, including the potential risk of insolvency of the Reference Item(s) issuer(s). Fluctuations in price of the Reference Item(s) may result in the investor losing the entire investment or a substantial part of it. An investment in the Securities does not create a direct investment in the underlying Reference Item(s). Where the Reference Item(s) is an equity/basket of equities, the investor will not be eligible to receive dividend payments or any voting rights associated with a direct investment in the Reference Item(s).\nFX Risk\nN/A\nCap on Return\nThe Securities\u2019 maximum possible return is limited as described. The return does not increase if the Reference Item(s) outperform(s) the stated maximum return. If the Reference Item(s) substantially outperform(s) the stated maximum return, an investment in the Securities may not be as attractive as a direct investment in the Reference Item(s), where this is possible.\nLiquidity Risk\nThe investor should be prepared to hold this Security until maturity should it not be called or terminated early, if such option exists, by the Issuer. The Dealer will, however, use its reasonable endeavours to provide liquidity to the Security (either directly or through an affiliate) but is not obliged to do so and may stop providing liquidity at any time without notice. This means an investor should not rely on having the ability to redeem the Security at a particular time or for a certain price. If the Security is redeemed early, the investor may get back less than the stated redemption amount. The Issue Price is not a direct reflection of the market value of the Security. The level at which the investor purchases the Security includes hedging costs and profits that the Dealer or its affiliates expect to incur or realize. The Issue Price may also include selling commissions paid by the Dealer to distributors and/or intermediaries. Any selling commissions, costs and profits will reduce the secondary market level, if any secondary market develops, for the Security. As a result, the investor may experience an immediate and substantial decline in the value of the Securities on the Issue Date.\nSuitability\nThis termsheet is provided for information purposes only and should not be used as the sole or primary basis of any investment decision.

Members of the Bank Group may perform a variety of roles in connection with the issuance. The Issuer, Dealer, or their affiliates may act as the Calculation Agent and may enter into positions in connection with the issuance. The Issuer, Dealer, or their affiliates may undertake hedging activity including trading in the Reference Item(s) or instruments related to the Reference Item(s), which may have an adverse impact on the value of the Securities. The Issuer, Dealer, or their affiliates may from time-to-time possess or have access to information concerning the Reference Item(s) and are under no obligation to disclose this information to investors. Any conflicts of interest will be managed in accordance with the Bank Group\u2019s established policies and procedures.\nTax Risk\nAn investment in the Securities may give rise to tax consequences. Any tax liability is dependent on the taxpayer\u2019s personal circumstances. The basis and level of any taxes may change during the term of the Security.\nOn-sale of Securities\nIt is strongly recommended that investors seek independent tax advice prior to an investment in the Securities. The Issuer, Dealer and members of the Bank Group do not provide tax advice. To the extent that any general information is provided with regard to tax, this is for information purposes only and should neither be construed as tax advice nor should it be relied on, or treated as a substitute for seeking independent tax advice.\nMedia Distribution\nNO\nIV.
