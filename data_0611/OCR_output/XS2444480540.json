PRODUCT DESCRIPTION\nThe Investor holds a positive view on the development of the underlyings. Furthermore, the Investor does not expect the final fixing of the worst performing underlying to be below its Barrier at maturity.\nAt maturity, if the final fixing of the worst performing underlying is equal to or greater than its Upside Strike, the Investor will receive the Nominal and benefit from increases in the final fixing of the worst performing underlying above its Upside Strike, subject to a cap. Otherwise, the Investor is taking the risk that in case the final fixing of the worst performing underlying is below its Barrier at maturity, the Investor will receive a cash amount worth less than the Nominal.\nPRODUCT DETAILS\nDATES\nIssue Size\nUSD 5'000'000\nTrade Date\nFebruary 24, 2022\nSecurity Numbers\nISIN: XS2444480540, Common Code: 244448054, Valor: 116686838\nInitial Fixing Date Issue Date\nFebruary 24, 2022 March 3, 2022\nNominal\nUSD 1'000\nFinal Fixing Date\nAugust 24, 2023\nIssue Price\n100%\nRedemption Date\nAugust 31, 2023\nUnderlying Cap\n120%\nMinimum Trading\nUSD 1'000\nNumber /Permitted Trading Multiple\nUNDERLYING INFORMATION\nUnderlying\nCurrency\nFixing (Initial)\nDownside Strike1\n1 Upside Strike\nBarrier1\nBloomberg / Reuters\n100%\n100%\n65%\nFTSE 100 Index UKX Index / .FTSE\nGBP\n7207.38\n7207.38\n7207.38\n4684.7970\nS&P 500\u00ae Index SPX Index / .SPX\nUSD\n4288.7\n4288.7\n4288.7\n2787.6550\nEURO STOXX 50\u00ae Index (Price EUR) SX5E Index / .STOXX50E\nEUR\n3829.29\n3829.29\n3829.29\n2489.0385\n1: Values expressed as percentage of Fixing (Initial) and displayed to 4 d.p.\nREDEMPTION\nNote Right\nEach Note entitles the Investor to receive on the Redemption Date either:\nPage 1\nSECURITIES DIVISION\n1:\nif each Fixing (Final) is equal to or above its Barrier:\nNominal x [111.9% + max(0%; min(8.1%; Fixing (Final)/Fixing(Initial) - 100%))]\n3:\nif at least one Fixing (Final) is below its respective Barrier:\nWorst Performance (Upside)\nThe Worst Performance (Upside) is calculated by dividing the Fixing (Final) by the Fixing\n(Initial) in relation to each Underlying.

PROFIT / LOSS PROSPECTS\nEffect of the performance of the Underlying(s) on the redemption amount\nMaximum Profit at Maturity/ Maximum Loss at Maturity\nNote specific risks\nPositive performance:\nIf the worst performing underlying performs positively, the investor realises a positive return.\nSideways to slightly negative performance: If the worst performing underlying performs sideways to slightly negative, the investor realises no return.\nPronounced negative performance:\nIf the worst performing underlying performs negatively and the Barrier is triggered, the investor realises a negative return. If the worst performing underlying performs negatively and the Barrier is not triggered, the investor realises no return.\nMaximum Loss: The minimum repayment of the Note is zero in case the final fixing of the worst performing underlying is worth zero at maturity.\nMaximum Profit: The Investor participates in movements of the worst performing underlying above its Upside Strike up to the cap, therefore the maximum repayment per Note is 120.00% (rounded to 2 d.p.) multiplied by the Nominal.\nThis product offers no minimum repayment amount and you may lose your entire investment. This product is intended to provide a limited maximum return, therefore your return will be lower than a direct investment in the underlyings in certain circumstances.\nIf a secondary market is offered in the product, the bid/offer spread will be subject to change and any such price is likely to be impacted by changes in factors including (but not limited to) the price of the underlyings, the volatility of the underlyings, dividends payable by the underlyings, prevailing interest rates, the time to maturity of the product and the credit spread of the Issuer.\nC. SIGNIFICANT RISKS FOR INVESTORS\nSuch information is also contained in sub-section \"Note specific risks\" of section \"B PROFIT / LOSS PROSPECTS\".\nRISK INFORMATION\nTHESE SECURITIES ARE NOT PRINCIPAL PROTECTED. THERE IS A RISK THAT YOU COULD LOSE ALL OF YOUR INVESTMENT.\nCredit risk: Investors in Securities will be exposed to the credit risk of Goldman Sachs. If the Issuer becomes insolvent or cannot make the payments on the Securities for any other reason, you will lose some or all of your investment. A decline in Goldman Sachs\u2019 credit quality is likely to reduce the market value of the Securities and therefore the price an investor may receive for the Securities if they were to sell them in the market.\nVolatility: These Securities are volatile instruments. Volatility refers to the degree of unpredictable change over time of a certain variable in this case the price, performance or investment return of a financial asset. Volatility does not imply direction of the price or investment returns. An instrument that is volatile is likely to increase or decrease in value more often and/or to a greater extent than one that is not volatile.\nPage 3\nSECURITIES DIVISION\nLeverage: These Securities may be subject to leverage. Where an investment is subject to leverage, the effective exposure to the underlying asset or payment reference is increased. Leverage may expose investors to increased losses where the value of underlying asset falls. Leverage can be embedded in derivative components of complex financial instruments.\nCombining investment types: These Securities may have some or all of the characteristics of debt and derivatives instruments. These elements could interact to produce both an enhanced possibility of loss of the initial investment or an enhanced return.\nInvestment return: The price of these Securities and the income generated, if any, may go down or up. You may realize losses on any investment made and you may get back nothing at all. You should read the Programme and the applicable Pricing Supplement for the final terms and conditions and for a description of related risks. Risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf The market price of the Securities may be influenced by many unpredictable factors, including economic conditions, the creditworthiness of GS, the value of any Underlyings and certain actions taken by GS (see Conflict of Interests below). Accordingly, if you sell your Securities prior to maturity you may receive less than the issue price of the Securities.\n\u25cf In the case of Securities referencing one or more indices or other underlying assets (collectively, the \u201cUnderlyings\u201d), changes in the price of the Securities may not correlate to changes in the value of the Underlyings; any declines or gains in the value of one Underlying may be more than offset by movements in the value of other Underlyings.\n\u25cf The price of these Securities may be adversely affected by trading and other transactions by GS relating to the Securities and/or any Underlyings\n\u25cf The price of these Securities could be significantly impacted by determinations that GS may make in its sole discretion from time to time as calculation agent and/or index sponsor, as the case may be.\nRelevant Information: GS may, by virtue of its status as an underwriter, advisor or otherwise, possess or have access to information relating to these Securities, and/or any Underlyings and any derivative instruments referencing them (together \u201cRelevant Instruments\u201d). GS will not be obliged to disclose any such Relevant Information to you.\nNo Exchange Guarantee nor Contract Ownership: These Securities are not guaranteed by an exchange nor does it result in the ownership of any futures contracts.\nNo Liquidity: There may be no market for these Securities. An investor must be prepared to hold them until the Redemption Date. GS may, but is not obliged to, make a market. If it does, it may cease at any time without notice.\nValuation: Assuming no change in market conditions or other factors, the value of these Securities on the Issue Date may be significantly less than the execution price on the trade date. If you unwind your investment early, you may receive less than the stated redemption amount.\nPrice Discrepancy: Any price quoted for these Securities by GS may differ significantly from (i) the Securities\u2019 value determined by reference to GS pricing models and (ii) any price quoted by a third party.\nForeign Exchange: Foreign currency denominated Securities are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates that could have an adverse effect on the value or price of, or income derived from, the investment.\nThe occurrence of an FX Disruption Event may lead to delayed payment and/or payment in USD: if the relevant currency is subject to convertibility, transferability, market disruption or other conditions affecting its availability at or about the time when a payment on the Securities comes due because of circumstances beyond our control, we will be entitled to make the payment in U.S. dollars or delay making the payment.\nSecondary market risks: The Dealer intends, under normal market conditions, to provide bid and offer prices for this Security on a regular basis. However, the Dealer makes no firm commitment to provide liquidity by means of bid and offer prices for this Security, and assumes no legal obligation to quote any such prices or with respect to the level or determination of such prices. Potential Investors therefore should not rely on the ability to sell this Security at a specific time or at a specific price.\nIn special market situations, where the Issuer is completely unable to enter into hedging transactions, or where such transactions are very difficult to enter into, the spread between the bid and offer prices may be temporarily expanded, in order to limit the economic risks of the Issuer.\nTaxation: The Issuer shall not be liable for or otherwise obliged to pay any present or future tax, duty, withholding or other similar payment which may arise as a result of the ownership, transfer or exercise of any Securities. Where such withholding or deduction is required by law, the appropriate withholding or deduction shall be made and the Issuer shall not have any obligation to pay any additional amounts to compensate for such withholding or deduction.\nPage 4\nSECURITIES DIVISION\nSection 871(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code: The U.S. Treasury Department has issued regulations under which amounts paid or deemed paid on certain financial instruments that are treated as attributable to U.S.-source dividends could be treated, in whole or in part depending on the circumstances, as a \"dividend equivalent\" payment that is subject to tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable treaty). We have determined that, as of the issue date of the Securities, the Securities will not be subject to withholding under these rules. In certain limited circumstances, however, it is possible for United States alien holders to be liable for tax under these rules with respect to a combination of transactions treated as having been entered into in connection with each other even when no withholding is required. United States alien holders should consult their tax advisor concerning these regulations, subsequent official guidance and regarding any other possible alternative characterisations of their Securities for United States federal income tax purposes.\nDISCLAIMER\nConflict of Interests: GS may from time to time be an active participant on both sides of the market for the Relevant Instruments at any time and have long or short positions in, or buy and sell Relevant Instruments (on a principal basis or otherwise) identical or related to those mentioned herein. GS\u2019 hedging and trading activities with respect to the Securities may affect the value of other Relevant Instruments and vice versa. GS may be calculation agent or sponsor of Underlyings and as such may make determinations affecting the value of the Securities.\nNo Offer: This term sheet has been prepared for discussion purposes only. It is not an offer to buy the Securities described within or enter into any agreement. Neither GS, nor any of their officers or employees is soliciting any action based upon it. Finalised terms and conditions are subject to further discussion and negotiation and also to GS internal legal, compliance and credit approval.\nNo Representation: GS makes no representations as to (a) the suitability of the Securities for any particular investor (b) the appropriate accounting treatment or possible tax consequences of investing in the Securities or (c) the future performance of the Securities either in absolute terms or relative to competing investments. Changes in the creditworthiness or performance of the Securities or any Underlying may affect the value of the Securities and could result in it redeeming or being valued at zero.\nNot Complete Information: This term sheet does not completely describe the merits and risks of the Securities and will, if a transaction results, be superseded by final legal documentation.\nNo Advice: This material should not be construed as investment, financial, strategic, legal, regulatory, accounting or tax advice. It does not take into account the particular investment objectives, financial situation or needs of individual clients. Certain transactions, including those involving futures, options and high yield securities, give rise to substantial risk and are not suitable for all investors. Accordingly clients should consider whether the Securities described herein are suitable for their particular circumstances and should consult their own accounting, tax, investment and legal advisors before investing.

GS does not accept any responsibility to update any opinions or other information contained in this material.\nRepresentation: If a transaction arises as a result of this term sheet you agree that you will not offer, sell or deliver the Securities in any jurisdiction except under circumstances that will result in compliance with the applicable laws thereof, and that you will take at your own expense whatever action is required to permit your purchase and resale of the Securities.
