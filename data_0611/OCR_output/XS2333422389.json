KENNEDY L-1855 Luxembourg\nSecondary Trading\nDaily price indications including accrued interest (dirty) will be published on Reuters, Bloomberg and Telekurs. No representation is made as to the existence of a market for the Certificates. BNP Paribas Arbitrage S.N.C. will endeavour to make a secondary market in the Certificates, subject to it being satisfied that normal market conditions prevail. Any prices indicated will be dependent upon factors affecting or likely to affect the value of the Certificates such as, but not limited to, the remaining time to the Redemption Date, the outstanding principal amount, the Issuer's or, if applicable, the Guarantor's credit risk, the performance and volatility of the underlying asset, interest rates, exchange rates, credit spreads, and any incidental costs. To the extent BNP Paribas Arbitrage S.N.C. holds Certificates that it can offer and subject to it being satisfied that normal market conditions prevail, such prices will have a bid-offer spread no greater than 1%. Holders should be aware that the secondary market price for any Certificate quoted on or after the fourth (4th) Clearing System Business Day preceding any date on which the Issuer is due to make a payment thereon, shall exclude the amount so payable per Certificate. The Holder of the Certificates on the record date, as determined by the rules of the relevant Clearing System, shall be entitled to receive or retain any such amount on the due date for payment thereof.\nSwiss Tax Information\nThe following Swiss tax summary is valid at the time of the issuance of the product. It is for general information only and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all Swiss tax consequences that may be relevant to a decision to purchase, own or dispose of the product. Swiss tax laws and the practice of the Swiss tax authorities may change, possibly with retroactive effect. Prospective Swiss resident, EU resident and third country resident purchasers of the product should consult their own tax advisers concerning the tax consequences of purchasing, holding and disposing of the product in the light of their particular circumstances.\nSwiss Federal Stamp Duty\nThis product is subject to Swiss stamp duty. Therefore, secondary market transactions are subject to Swiss stamp duty.\nSwiss Withholding Tax\nThe product is not subject to the Swiss withholding tax.\nSwiss Income Tax\nThis product is classified as transparent, where the majority of the return of the bondpart is in the form of a payment at redemption (IUP). Therefore, private investor with tax domicile in Switzerland, is subject to the Swiss Federal Income Tax on the difference between the bondfloor at purchase and the bondfloor at sale or redemption (if denominated in foreign currency these amounts must be converted into CHF by applying the prevailing exchange rate at purchase date and sale or redemption date when applicable). The present value of the bond part at issue is 99.2398% (ref.rate: 0.4956%). However, any gain derived from the option is considered as a capital gain and therefore for such investor not subject to the Swiss federal, cantonal or communal Income Tax.\nAutomatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters\nSwitzerland has implemented the Automatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters (\"AEOI\") as of 1st January 2017 with the EU and various other countries and is negotiating the introduction of the AEOI with further countries. The website \"www.sif.admin.ch\" provides an overview of all partner states Switzerland has signed an agreement for the introduction of the AEOI. In this context the EU Savings Tax for Swiss paying agents and the Final Withholding Tax with UK and Austria have been repealed as from 1st January 2017.\n2. PROSPECTS FOR PROFITS AND LOSSES\nProfits Prospects Loss Prospects\nTo be confirmed\nTo be confirmed\nIn the event that the Certificates are redeemed early as a consequence of force majeure, illegality or certain other events affecting the Underlying(s) and/or hedge, Holders may receive an amount per Certificate equal to the fair market value of each Certificate less the cost to the Issuer and/or its affiliates of unwinding any underlying related hedging arrangements. Such amount may be less than the Notional Amount or even zero.\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n4\nEquity Derivatives Solutions\nBNP PARIBAS CORPORATE & INSTITUTIONAL BANKING\n- The bank for a changing world\n3. IMPORTANT RISKS\nGeneral\nAn investment in the Certificates involves a high degree of risk, which may include, among others, price risks associated with the Underlying(s), interest rate, foreign exchange, market, time value and political risks. Potential investors must have the knowledge and experience necessary to enable them to evaluate the risks and merits of an investment in the Certificates. A prospective investor should determine, based on its own independent review and such professional advice (including, without limitation, tax, accounting, credit, legal and regulatory advice) as it deems appropriate under the circumstances, that its acquisition and holding of the Certificates (i) is fully consistent with its financial needs, objectives and condition, (ii) complies and is fully consistent with all investment policies, guidelines and restrictions applicable to it and (iii) is a fit, proper and suitable investment for it, notwithstanding the clear and substantial risks inherent in investing in or holding the Certificates. In making such determination, a prospective investor should consider carefully all the information set forth in the Final Terms and the Base Prospectus.\nNo Capital Protection\nThe Certificates are not capital protected at any time. There is a risk of total capital loss, and therefore an investment in the Certificates is highly speculative, involving significant risk, including the possible loss of all the entire amount invested, and should therefore only be considered by persons who can afford a loss of all of their investment.\nIndex Linked Risks\nAn investment in Certificates linked to an Index entails significant risks not associated with an investment in a conventional debt security. On redemption Holders will receive an amount (if any) determined by reference to the value of the Index. Potential investors should take advice accordingly. The movements in the level of an index may be subject to significant fluctuations that may or may not correlate with other indices, changes in interest rates or currencies and the timing of changes in the relevant level of the index may affect the actual yield to Holders, even if the average level of the index is consistent with their expectations.\nEarly Redemption\nThe Terms and Conditions in the Base Prospectus provide for early redemption on the occurrence of force majeure, illegality and certain other events affecting the Underlying(s) and/or the hedge, whereupon the Calculation Agent shall calculate the fair market value of each Certificate less the cost to the Issuer and/or its affiliates of unwinding any underlying related hedging arrangements, all as determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole and absolute discretion. Payment will be made in such manner as shall be notified to Holders in accordance with the Condition 10 of the Base Prospectus. The amount Holders receive as a consequence of such early redemption may be less than the Notional Amount per Certificate or even zero. Holders who choose to reinvest monies received as a consequence of early redemption of the Certificates may be able to do so only in securities with a lower yield than the redeemed Certificates.\nIssuer and Guarantor Risk\nCertificates are unsecured obligations: The Certificates retention of value is dependent not only on the development of the value of the Underlying(s), but also the creditworthiness of the Issuer and the Guarantor, which may change over the term of the product. The Certificates are unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer and will rank pari passu with all other unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer. The obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantee are unsecured obligations of the Guarantor and will rank pari passu with all its other present and future senior preferred and unsecured obligations, subject as may from time to time be mandatory under French law. In addition, the Issuer's and the Guarantor's ability to fulfil their obligations under the Certificates may be affected by certain other factors, including liquidity risks, market risks, credit risks, cross- border and foreign exchange risks, operational risks, legal and regulatory risks and competition risks.\n5\nEquity Derivatives Solutions\nBNP PARIBAS CORPORATE & INSTITUTIONAL BANKING - The bank for a changing world\nPossible Illiquidity of the Certificates in the Secondary Market\nIt is not possible to predict the price at which Certificates will trade in the secondary market. The trading market for the Certificates may be volatile and may be adversely impacted by many events. An active trading market for the Certificates may not develop. The Issuer and/or its affiliates may (but is not obliged to) at any time purchase Certificates in the open market. Any Certificates so purchased may be resold or surrendered for cancellation. To the extent the Certificates are cancelled the number of Certificates outstanding will decrease resulting in diminished liquidity for the remaining Certificates. A decrease in the liquidity of the Certificates may cause, in turn, an increase in the volatility associated with the price of the Certificates. There may be no secondary market for the Certificates and to the extent that such secondary market becomes illiquid, Holders may have to wait until redemption of the Certificates to realise greater value than their then trading value.\nUnpredictable Market Value\nThe market value of, and expected return on, the Certificates may be influenced by a number of factors, some or all of which may be unpredictable (and which may offset or magnify each other), such as (i) supply and demand for the Certificates, (ii) the development of the value of the Underlying(s) (iii) economic, financial, political and regulatory or judicial events that affect the Issuer, the Guarantor, the Underlying(s) or financial markets generally, (iv) interest and yield rates in the markets generally, (v) the time remaining until the Redemption Date and (vi) the creditworthiness of the Issuer and the Guarantor. Such factors may mean that the trading price of the Certificates is below the Notional Amount. In the secondary market a bid/ask spread will generally apply. Holders who choose to sell their Certificates prior to maturity may receive less than the amount invested.\nEffective yield\nA Holder's actual yield on the Certificates may be reduced from the stated yield by transaction costs or the tax impact on that Holder of its investment in the Certificates.\nAdditional Risks\nIn addition, investors should read the section in the Base Prospectus entitled 'Risk Factors'.\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\nNeither BNP Paribas nor any of its affiliates gives any assurance that any Certificate will be issued or any transaction will be entered into on the basis of the terms set out in this document. The information contained in this document is provided to you alone and you agree that it may not be distributed by you other than in compliance with the applicable securities laws and regulations in force in the jurisdiction(s) in which you offer the Certificates described in this document (the \"Certificates\"). If you have received a copy of this document from anyone other than BNP Paribas or any distributor, it will not contain all the information required for you to assess its contents.\nBNP Paribas is not providing the recipients of this document with any investment advice or recommendation to enter into any potential transaction. Any purchaser of Certificates, other than a BNP Paribas counterparty or distributor, will be purchasing the Certificates from such counterparty or distributor and will have no contractual relationship with BNP Paribas or any of its affiliates. In particular BNP Paribas will not be responsible for assessing the appropriateness or suitability of an investment in the Certificates in relation to such third parties.\nThis document should be read together with the base prospectus for the Certificates (including any Supplements to it, the \"Base Prospectus\") and the applicable Final Terms for the Certificates (when available) and these documents prevail over any prior communications or materials relating to the terms of the Certificates. Potential investors should carefully read the sections headed \"Risk Factors\" in the Base Prospectus and the Final Terms for a full description of the potential risks associated with the Certificates, and \"Offering and Sale\", for certain limitations on the purchase and onward sales of the Certificates.\nAny illustrative price quotations, investment cases or market analysis contained in this document or any related marketing materials we may have provided to you have been prepared on assumptions and parameters that reflect our good faith judgment or selection but must be subject to your own independent analysis and due diligence before you make any investment decision. Any reference to an Issue Price in this document is not necessarily an expression of the market value of the Securities. You should conduct your own independent analysis or seek independent advice as to any market value of the Securities. Please note that there can be conflicts of interests between BNP Paribas and potential investors (see below) and we can therefore not assume any responsibility for the financial consequences of your investment decision, which must be independent. We require that you undertake your own independent due diligence and avail yourself of your own advisors in order to assess the suitability of the Certificates in relation to your own financial objectives. Accordingly, if you decide to purchase the Certificates, you will be deemed to understand and accept the terms, conditions and risks associated with the Certificates. You will also be deemed to act for your own account, to have made your own independent decision to purchase the Certificates and to declare that such transaction is appropriate\n6\nEquity Derivatives Solutions\n7\nThe bank for a changing world\nfor you based upon your own judgment the advice from such advisers as you have deemed necessary to consult. Each holder of the Certificates shall also be deemed to assume and be responsible for any and all taxes of any jurisdiction or governmental or regulatory authority and should consult their own tax advisers in this respect.\nYou should note and assess for the purposes of any investment decision that members of the BNP Paribas group may face possible conflicts of interest in connection with certain duties under the Certificates, such as trading in an underlying for their own account or for the account of others, receiving fees in a number of capacities or taking market views which are not consistent with the objective of the Certificates.\nInvestors Responsibilities\nThe Certificates may be distributed to non qualified investors in Switzerland however no action has been or will be taken in any other jurisdiction that would, or is intended to, permit a public offering of the Certificates.\nThe Certificates are sold to investors on the understanding that they will comply with all relevant securities laws and public offer requirements in the jurisdictions in which the Certificates are placed or resold, including, without limitation, the Prospectus Regulation and the relevant applicable laws or regulations in any EU member state relating thereto.\nSelling Restrictions\nThe Certificates may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons at any time (as defined in regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 or the U.S. internal revenue code). The Certificates have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the securities laws of any state in the United States, and are subject to U.S. tax requirements. In purchasing the Certificates you represent and warrant that you are neither located in the United States nor a U.S. person and that you are not purchasing for the account or benefit of any such person. The Certificates may not be offered, sold, transferred or delivered without compliance with all applicable securities laws and regulations.\nInvestors should note that BNP Paribas acting as Guarantor is licensed as a credit institution in France and as such is subject to the new resolution regime introduced by the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive of 15 May 2014. This new regulation, among others, gives resolution authorities the power to amend the key terms of the Guarantee, to reduce the amounts payable by the Guarantor under the terms of the Guarantee (including a reduction to zero) and convert the amounts due under the Guarantee into shares or other securities. You may not be able to recover all or even part of the amount due under the Certificates (if any) from the Guarantor under the Guarantee or you may receive a different security issued by the Guarantor (or another person) in place of the amount (if any) due to you under the Certificates by the Issuer, which may be worth significantly less than the amount due to you\nBNP Paribas is lead supervised by the ECB and the ACPR and is authorised by the ECB and the ACPR.
