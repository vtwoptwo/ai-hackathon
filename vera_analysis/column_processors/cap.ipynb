The increase of the value of the bond part (according to the “Modifizierte Differenzbesteuerung”) at sale or maturity is subject to Swiss income tax. Private investors are taxed on the difference between the value of the bond part at purchase* and the value of the bond part at sale* or redemption*. However, any gain from the option part is considered as private capital gain and therefore in principle not subject to Swiss income tax. The value of the bond part on Issue Date will be USD 946.97 (indicative) per Note. The value of the bond part on Maturity Date will be USD 1,000 per Note.\\n* each to be converted into CHF at the prevailing exchange rate at purchase and sale or maturity.\\nB) Swiss Withholding Tax\\nThe Notes are not subject to Swiss withholding tax.\\nC) Swiss Stamp Taxes\\nFor Swiss stamp duty purpose, the Notes are treated as analogous to a foreign bond. Therefore, the issuance (primary market) is not subject to Swiss stamp duty. However, secondary market transactions are in principle subject to Swiss stamp duty (TK 22).\\nThe before mentioned tax treatment applies at the Issue Date. The relevant tax laws and/or the regulation and practice of the tax authorities may change at any time. Please note that this tax information does not replace professional tax advice from a personal tax advisor considering the particular circumstances of a holder or a prospective holder. Therefore, Royal Bank of Canada highly recommends consulting the personal tax advisor as to the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership, sale or exercise of these Notes. Royal Bank of Canada hereby expressly excludes any liabilities in respect of any tax implications arising thereof.\\nAutomatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters\\nSwitzerland has implemented the Automatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters (\"AEOI\") as of 1st January 2017 with the EU and various other countries and is negotiating the introduction of the AEOI with further countries. The website \"www.sif.admin.ch\" provides an overview of all partner states Switzerland has signed an agreement for the introduction of the AEOI.\\nII. PROFIT AND LOSS\\nPROFIT AND LOSS\\nThis security falls in the category “yield enhancement”.\\nThis means that there is an upper limit to the profit investors may realize. The maximum amount investors may receive over the term of the security is their invested capital, excluding any transaction or other costs, plus bonus payments. On the downside, investors are exposed to the negative development of the Reference Items. This could lead to a partial or even a total loss of investment.\\nRBC Europe Limited Registered in England and Wales: 995939 RBC Europe Limited Registered Address: 100 Bishopsgate London EC2N 4AA Authorised by the Prudential Regulatory Authority (\"PRA\") and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") and the PRA\\n5 / 15\\nPlease refer to the section “Product Description”.\\nEffect of the performance of the Reference Items on the redemption amount:\\nPositive performance:\\nIf the Reference Items performs positively, the investor realises no return.\\nSideways to slightly negative performance:\\nIf the Reference Items performs sideways to slightly negative, the investor realises no return or a slightly negative return. Pronounced negative performance:\\nIf the Reference Items performs negatively, the investor realises negative return.\\nIII. SIGNIFICANT RISKS FOR INVESTORS\\nRISKS\\nProduct Risk\\nThese Securities are capital at risk. This means there is a risk that you could lose your entire investment or part of it. These Securities are not guaranteed against losses by the Issuer, Dealer, their affiliates, the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme or any equivalent European deposit guarantee scheme.\\nU.S. Withholding Tax on Dividend Equivalent Payments\\nThe United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, treats a “dividend equivalent” payment as a dividend from sources within the United States. Unless reduced by an applicable tax treaty with the United States, such payments generally would be subject to U.S. withholding tax of 30% if paid to a non-U.S. holder. A non- U.S. holder is a beneficial owner of a Note that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is a non-resident alien individual, a foreign corporation, or a foreign estate or trust. Under recently finalized U.S. Treasury Department regulations, payments on certain equity-linked instruments (including deemed payments) that are contingent upon or determined by Reference to actual or estimated U.S. source dividends, (regardless of whether such contingency or determination is explicitly stated or implicitly taken into account in computing one or more of the terms of such instruments) may be treated as dividend equivalents subject to withholding tax. Withholding tax will apply to dividend equivalent payments on Notes issued or materially modified on or after January 1, 2017. If any payments are treated as dividend equivalent subject to withholding, we (or the applicable paying agent) would be required to withhold taxes and would not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld. Prospective investors of the Notes should consult their own tax advisers regarding the application of the U.S. rules for withholding on dividend equivalents.\\nIssuer Risk\\nInvestors bear the issuer risk. The Security’s value and the payment of any income or bonus amount (where one is payable) are dependent not only on the development of the Reference Item, but also on the creditworthiness of the Issuer, which may vary over the term of the Security. The ratings of the Issuer noted above reflect the independent opinion of the rating agencies as to the safety of payments of principal and interest. These ratings are not a guarantee of credit quality. The ratings do not take into consideration any risk associated with fluctuations in the market value of this Security, or where factors other than the Issuer’s credit quality determine the level of principal and interest payments.\\nReference Item\\nThe value of the Security is linked to the Reference Item(s). The past performance of the Reference Item(s) is not an indication or guarantee of future performance. Any decision to invest in the Securities should not be based solely or primarily on the past performance of the Reference Item(s). The performance of the Reference Item(s) may be volatile and subject to unpredictable changes over the term of the Security. The investor should be prepared to assume this risk, including the potential risk of insolvency of the Reference Item(s) issuer(s). Fluctuations in price of the Reference Item(s) may result in the investor losing the entire investment or a substantial part of it.\\nRBC Europe Limited Registered in England and Wales: 995939 RBC Europe Limited Registered Address: 100 Bishopsgate London EC2N 4AA\\nAuthorised by the Prudential Regulatory Authority (\"PRA\") and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") and the PRA\\n6 / 15\\nAn investment in the Securities does not create a direct investment in the underlying Reference Item(s). Where the Reference Item(s) is an equity/basket of equities, the investor will not be eligible to receive dividend payments or any voting rights associated with a direct investment in the Reference Item(s).\\nFX Risk Quanto\\nThis Security incorporates a Quanto feature because the currencies of the Reference Items are different to the currency of the Securities. This feature means that when calculating the return of the Securities, the performance of the Reference Items in their base currency is not adjusted to account for the exchange rate between the two currencies at such time. You should also be aware that movements in interest rates of both currencies will affect the valuation of a security using this feature. This exposure to currency exchange fluctuations may come at a cost or benefit to you depending on how currency exchange rates move during the term of the Security. Currency exchange rates may be volatile and subject to unpredictable changes over the term of the Security.\\nLiquidity Risk\\nThe investor should be prepared to hold this Security until maturity should it not be called or terminated early, if such option exists, by the Issuer. The Dealer will, however, use its reasonable endeavours to provide liquidity to the Security (either directly or through an affiliate) but is not obliged to do so and may stop providing liquidity at any time without notice. This means an investor should not rely on having the ability to redeem the Security at a particular time or for a certain price. If the Security is redeemed early, the investor may get back less than the stated redemption amount. The Issue Price is not a direct reflection of the market value of the Security. The level at which the investor purchases the Security includes hedging costs and profits that the Dealer or its affiliates expect to incur or realize. The Issue Price may also include selling commissions paid by the Dealer to distributors and/or intermediaries. Any selling commissions, costs and profits will reduce the secondary market level, if any secondary market develops, for the Security. As a result, the investor may experience an immediate and substantial decline in the value of the Securities on the Issue Date.\\nSuitability\\nThis termsheet is provided for information purposes only and should not be used as the sole or primary basis of any investment decision.

The Issuer, Dealer, or their affiliates may from time-to-time possess or have access to information concerning the Reference Item(s) and are under no obligation to disclose this information to investors. Any conflicts of interest will be managed in accordance with the Bank Group’s established policies and procedures.\\nTax Risk\\nAn investment in the Securities may give rise to tax consequences. Any tax liability is dependent on the taxpayer’s personal circumstances. The basis and level of any taxes may change during the term of the Security.\\nOn-sale of Securities\\nIt is strongly recommended that investors seek independent tax advice prior to an investment in the Securities. The Issuer, Dealer and members of the Bank Group do not provide tax advice. To the extent that any general information is provided with regard to tax, this is for information purposes only and should neither be construed as tax advice nor should it be relied on, or treated as a substitute for seeking independent tax advice.\\nCalculation of the Reference Index\\nN/A\\nMedia Distribution\\nNO\\nIV.

The Issuer does not take any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of such information. Calculation of the S&P Index\\nThe S&P Index is published by S&P and is intended to provide an indication of the pattern of common stock price movement of the stocks included in the S&P Index. The calculation of the value of the S&P Index (discussed below in further detail) is based on the relative value of the aggregate market value (“Market Value”) of the common stocks of 500 companies as of a particular time as compared to the aggregate average Market Value of the common stocks of 500 similar companies during the base period of the years 1941 through 1943.\\nAs of 29th April, 1994, the 500 companies included in the S&P Index represented approximately 74% of the aggregate Market Value of common stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange; however, the 500 companies are not the 500 largest companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and not all 500 companies are listed on such exchange. S&P chooses companies for inclusion in the S&P Index with the aim of achieving a distribution by broad industry groupings that approximates the distribution of these groupings in the common stock population of the New York Stock Exchange, which S&P uses as an assumed model for the composition of the total market. Relevant criteria employed by S&P include the viability of the particular company, the extent to which the company represents the industry group to which it is assigned, the extent to which the market price of the company’s common stock is generally responsive to changes in the affairs of the respective industry and the Market Value and trading activity of the common stock of that company. S&P may from time to time, in its sole discretion, add companies, to, or delete companies from, the S&P Index to achieve the objectives stated above.\\nThe S&P Index is a weighted arithmetic index. This means that a change in the price of any stock is weighted by the total market capitalisation of the company rather than its price per stock. Stock prices are taken from the New York Stock Exchange and the S&P Index is currently updated each minute of the day, from 9:30a.m. to 4:30p.m. (New York time), in order to provide accurate information on a continuous real time basis. The level of the S&P Index appears, inter alia, on Bloomberg Ticker SPX Index. Disclaimer The S&P Index is currently sponsored by Standard & Poor’s, a Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
